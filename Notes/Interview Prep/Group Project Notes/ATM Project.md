# ATM Project  

Implemented an ATM using access control features of Java.

Introductory project that focused on deciding when to set class members to private or public, creating accessors to access the underlying fields.  

* We used an account services class to to hold all of our transaction methods. This utilized the principle of abstraction by hiding the details of how the transactions were calculated from the user.
  
*  We used an Account Class and had all of our subaccounts extend from the account class. This used the principle of inheritance by allowing us to create similar objects from the Account object without having to rewrite all of the code.
